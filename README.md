# My favorite movie
#### Spiderman Far From Home
Spiderman Far From Home is my favorite movie because it provides really great character development for Peter Parker as Tom Holland. It also explores the different possible outcomes and interactions between the different Spidermen and their villains by putting them into one universe. Like how Dr. Octo became a good person because the nanotech in Tom Holland Spiderman's suit hacked the chip that is making him evil thus, making him a crucial character that acts out of goodwill. Another is exploring how deranged the green goblin can be. It also provided great closure for the other spidermen like Tobey's with Dr. Octo and Andrew Garfield's with his Gwen Stacy by saving Tom Holland's version of Gwen. These are some of the many reasons why I like the movie, not even including its amazing ending.
